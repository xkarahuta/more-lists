"""
A fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
Starting with 0 and 1, the first ten terms are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.

Your task here is to write code that will fill in the list called 'fib' so that it contains
the first 50 terms of the fibonacci sequence, starting with 0


# Don't try writing the code all at once. Break it down into pieces
# I have some tips below that will help you figure this out. You can delete them (and the code that goes with them) when you no longer need them
"""

fib = [0, 1]

# TIP: How can you refer to the last item in a list? Print the last item in the list called fib

# TIP: How about the second to last item?

# TIP: How could you use the two items you've already accessed to generate the next term? Print the next term of the fibonacci sequence

# TIP: Now that you've figured out how to generate the next item in your sequence, how would you add it to the end of your list

# TIP: You've gotten the next item in the sequence and added it to your list - now how do you repeat it?
# There are two good options based on your current knowledge - you could repeat a certain number of times (what type of loop is that?)
# or you could repeat as long as there are too few items in the list (what type of loop is that?)
# You might want to refresh your memory by creating a simple loop of the type you want first






# DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE #
# I have code here that will help you know if your answer works
# Don't just copy and paste the list - that is NOT a valid answer
# Don't change the name of the list above or the error checking will not work correctly
